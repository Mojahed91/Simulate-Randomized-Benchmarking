# Simulating Randomized Benchmarking and Interleaved RB

This project offers a comprehensive simulation of both randomized benchmarking (RB) and interleaved RB. We've designed the simulation to account for the effect introduced by coherent errors, as well as the implications of various quantum channels.

## Parameters Description

The project provides a detailed parameter setup to offer customizable simulations:

* Length of the Cliffords: Define the sequence length for the Cliffords.
* Average Error Rate: Set the strength of the average error rate for the chosen quantum channel.
* Interleaved Gate Error Strength: Specify the strength of the error channel associated with the interleaved gate.
* Number of Shots: Determine the number of iterations for running both the RB and IRB protocols.
* Type of Interleaved Gate: Choose between gates such as CNOT, SWAP, or single-qubit gate.
* Y-axis Scale: Option to represent the plot's y-axis in either exponential or log scale.
* Strength of Coherent Error: Indicate the intensity of the coherent error influencing the process.
